Android Studio Folders of Frontend Apps for avr4iot Apps

1. IrTerm1 has the bluetooth connection to the AVR board, and 10 digit buttons to send a digit letter for each button.
2. IrTerm2 has the bluetooth connection to the AVR board which is also connected to the infra-red code transmitter and receiver mini-board, and three fragments that can be plugged in the main activity, one at a time. The first fragment a list of the remote controller buttons, each with the corresponding code, respectively. Select a button in the list, and emit an IR signal at the IR-transistor of the mini-board by pushing the corresponding button in the real remote contoller. Then the code will appear as a hex number at the right of the button icon. Do the same for the rest of the buttons to copy the entire button codes of the remote controller. The second and the third fragements have buttons in two different grid-style layout. Each button in the grids will send the copied code to the AVR board, and finally to the IR-LED of the mini-board. The IR light signals will control the TV set as the remote controller does.
3. IrTerm3 has all the features of irTerm2 + Speech to Text which enables us to send the code by a voice command.
